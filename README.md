## Overview
In this project several statistical analysis tools are used to provide insights into the dataset. The dataset, contained in the file `ab_data.csv` shows values for whether visitors to a web page clicked on a link on the page, and is divided into control versus treatment groups where the control groups visited the original landing page for the website, while the treatment group was sent to a new site. Please note that there is an issue with the files in this repository, and right now the correct Jupyter Notebook file for this project is in the folder, `submit-acc01208-3c8c-402e-8111-0060a03db494/home` and is named 'Analyze-ab-test-results_notebook.ipynb`.

## Requirements
This code depends on the following libraries:
1. `numpy`
2. `pandas`
3. `random`
4. `matplotlib.pyplot`
5. `statsmodels.api`
6. `norm` from `scipy.stats`
7. `call` from `subprocess`

In addition to these, the Jupyter Notebook assumes that the data set from 'ab_data.csv' is in the project folder.

The Binder badge above can be used to explore an executable environment for this project.

## Issues

- fix project file mix-up
- review project file
- review additional dataset `countries.csv`
- add 'Features' to README.md
